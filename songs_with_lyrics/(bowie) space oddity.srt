Ground Control to Major Tom

2
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,210
Ground Control to Major Tom

3
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:53,650
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on

4
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,990
Ground Control to Major Tom

5
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:06,240
Commencing countdown engines on

6
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:15,630
Check ignition and may God′s love be with you

7
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:31,410
This is Ground Control to Major Tom

8
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,650
You have really made the grade

9
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,200
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear

10
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:49,810
Now It is time to leave the capsule if you dare

11
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,200
This is Major Tom to Ground Control

12
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,670
I am stepping through the door

13
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:07,670
And I am floating in a most peculiar way

14
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:15,220
And the stars look very
different today

15
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,500
For here

16
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,150
Am I sitting in a tin can

17
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:29,880
Far above the world

18
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,460
Planet Earth is blue

19
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:39,820
And there′s nothing I can do

20
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:11,770
Though I am past one hundred thousand miles

21
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,340
I am feeling very still

22
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:22,040
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go

23
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:29,950
Tell my wife I love her very much she knows

24
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:34,470
Ground Control to Major Tom

25
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,100
Your circuit is dead there′s something wrong

26
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,920
Can you hear me Major Tom

27
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,050
Can you hear me Major Tom

28

00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:01,850
Far above the moon

31
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,260
Planet Earth is blue

32
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,520
And there′s nothing I can do
