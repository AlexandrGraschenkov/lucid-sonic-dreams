Intro
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Cool guy with sunglasses slapping a beat on a guitar

Intro
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Groovy guitar setting in

Intro
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Light-weight whistling mixes in with the other instruments

Intro
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:38,000
A guy with sunglasses whistles even more than before

Intro
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:48,000
A second, stronger guitar starts playing a funky tune

Intro
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The bald Yannic Kilcher with sunglasses on

1
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm curling in my sleeping bag

2
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,000
all dressed up in my shower cap

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,000
soon I'll be on the largest screen

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,000
with my head in a guillotine

5
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,000
My hair smells like an old dishrag

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,000
my face looks like a used doormat

7
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,000
my spine is like a horizontal bar

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,000
These are just some things you'll find in ImageNet

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,000
A thousand cuts of joy, but mostly things to pet

10
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,000
be my weasel

11
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,000
be my pig

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,000
be my badger

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,000
on an offshore rig

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,000
find a beagle

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,000
catch a slug

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and bring them all to my whiskey jug

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,000
watch out for the king snake

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,000
the vine snake

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,000
the green snake

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,000
and don't forget the night snake

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,000
the sea snake

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and the pug

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,000

and bring them all to my whiskey jug

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And there I sit, in a rocking chair

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,000
looking for my purple hare

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,000
what's inside this wooden chest

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,000
maybe my bulletproof vest

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I hear a border collie cry

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,000
A bernese mountain dog goes by

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And all the while two hummingbirds stay near

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,000
These are just some things you'll find in ImageNet

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,000
A thousand cuts of joy, but mostly things to pet

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,000
be my weasel

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,000
be my pig

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,000
be my badger

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,000
on an offshore rig

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,000

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,000
catch a slug

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,000
and bring them all to my whiskey jug

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,000
watch out for the king snake

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,000
the vine snake

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,000
the green snake

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,000
and don't forget the night snake

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,000
the sea snake

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,000
and the pug

00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,000
find a beagle

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,000
catch a slug

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,000
and bring them all to my whiskey jug

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,000
be my weasel

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,000
be my pig

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,000
be my badger

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,000
on an offshore rig

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,000
find a beagle

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,000
