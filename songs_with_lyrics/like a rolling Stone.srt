1
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,113
Once upon a time you
dressed so fine

2
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:19,219
Threw the bums a dime in your
prime, didn't you?

3
00:00:21,653 --> 00:00:24,490
People call say 'beware doll,
you're bound to fall'

4
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:29,028
You thought they were all
kidding you

5
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:35,701
You used to laugh about

6
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:40,740
Everybody that was hanging out

7
00:00:41,607 --> 00:00:44,743
Now you don't talk so loud

8
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:49,582
Now you don't seem so proud

9
00:00:50,682 --> 00:00:53,219
About having to be scrounging

10
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,425
your next meal

11
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:01,428
How does it feel,

12
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,399
how does it feel?

13
00:01:09,001 --> 00:01:11,437
To be without a home

14
00:01:14,073 --> 00:01:16,408
Like a complete unknown,

15
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:21,414
like a rolling stone

16
00:01:32,257 --> 00:01:36,562
Ahh you've gone to the finest
schools, alright Miss Lonely

17
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:40,733
But you know you only used to
get juiced in it

18
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:46,306
Nobody's ever taught you how
to live out on the street

19
00:01:46,305 --> 00:01:50,709
And now you're gonna have to get
used to it

20
00:01:54,713 --> 00:01:57,483
You say you never compromise

21
00:01:58,584 --> 00:02:02,454
With the mystery tramp,
but now you realize

22
00:02:03,522 --> 00:02:07,359
He's not selling any alibis

23
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:11,897
As you stare into the vacuum
of his eyes

24
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:15,568
And say do you want to

25
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:21,875
make a deal?

26
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,710
How does it feel,

27
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,882
how does it feel?

28
00:02:31,617 --> 00:02:33,620
To be on your own,

29
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,625
with no direction home

30
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,695
A complete unknown,

31
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:48,700
like a rolling stone

32
00:02:59,444 --> 00:03:03,215
Ah you never turned around to
see the frowns

33
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:08,454
On the jugglers and the clowns
when they all did tricks for you

34
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:12,824
You never understood that it
ain't no good

35
00:03:12,824 --> 00:03:17,896
You shouldn't let other people
get your kicks for you

36
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,904
You used to ride on a chrome
horse with your diplomat

37
00:03:26,004 --> 00:03:29,942
Who carried on his shoulder
a Siamese cat

38
00:03:30,842 --> 00:03:34,346
Ain't it hard when you
discovered that

39
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:39,419
He really wasn't where it's at

40
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:49,228
After he took from you
everything he could steal

41
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,064
How does it feel,

42
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,135
how does it feel?

43
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,407
To have on your own,

44
00:04:03,408 --> 00:04:06,144
with no direction home

45
00:04:08,413 --> 00:04:11,083
Like a complete unknown,

46
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:16,122
like a rolling stone

47
00:04:26,531 --> 00:04:31,204
Ahh princess on a steeple and
all the pretty people

48
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:35,641
They're all drinking, thinking
that they've got it made

49
00:04:38,043 --> 00:04:40,479
Exchanging all precious gifts

50
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:45,251
But you better take
your diamond ring,
you better pawn it babe

51
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:52,692
You used to be so amused

52
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:57,530
At Napoleon in rags and
the language that he used

53
00:04:58,197 --> 00:05:01,701
Go to him he calls you,
you can't refuse

54
00:05:02,968 --> 00:05:07,139
When you ain't got nothing,
you got nothing to lose

55
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:16,215
You're invisible now,
you've got no secrets to conceal

56
00:05:16,214 --> 00:05:18,250
How does it feel,

57
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,222
ah, how does it feel?

58
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,194
To be on your own,

59
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:33,432
with no direction home

60
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,603
Like a complete unknown,

61
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:43,609
like a rolling stone
