1
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:12,183
(piano playing)

2
00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:31,335
Commander Hadfield (singing): Ground control to major Tom

3
00:00:33,521 --> 00:00:37,176
Ground control to major Tom

4
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,482
Lock your Soyuz hatch and put your helmet on

5
00:00:47,621 --> 00:00:52,225
Ground control to major Tom

6
00:00:54,595 --> 00:00:58,539
Commencing countdown, engines on

7
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,671
Detach from Station, and may god's love be with you

8
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,992
(piano playing)

9
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:17,231
(music swells)

10
00:01:18,262 --> 00:01:26,822
This is ground control to major Tom, you've really made the grade

11
00:01:27,882 --> 00:01:33,345
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear

12
00:01:35,346 --> 00:01:41,381
But it's time to guide the capsule if you da-a-a-are

13
00:01:43,305 --> 00:01:51,535
This is major Tom to ground control, I've left forevermore

14
00:01:52,981 --> 00:01:58,763
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way

15
00:01:59,962 --> 00:02:06,098
And the stars look very different toda-a-a-ay

16
00:02:07,668 --> 00:02:14,317
For here am I sitting in a tin can

17
00:02:14,965 --> 00:02:20,141
Far above the world

18
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:30,899
Planet Earth is blue and there's nothing left to do

19
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:37,540
(acoustic guitar riff)

20
00:02:38,138 --> 00:02:47,153
(music swells)

21
00:02:58,891 --> 00:03:03,477
Though I've flown one hundred thousand miles

22
00:03:03,877 --> 00:03:07,560
I'm feeling very still

23
00:03:08,806 --> 00:03:14,016
And before too long I know it's time to go

24
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:22,504
Our Commander comes down back to earth and knows

25
00:03:23,812 --> 00:03:26,994
Ground control to major Tom,

26
00:03:26,995 --> 00:03:30,116
The time is near, there's not too long

27
00:03:30,116 --> 00:03:33,551
Can you hear me, Major Tom?

28
00:03:33,842 --> 00:03:37,013
Can you hear me, Major Tom?

29
00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:40,611
Can you hear me, Major Tom?

30
00:03:40,611 --> 00:03:41,469
Can you...

31
00:03:41,469 --> 00:03:47,205
Here am I floating in my tin can

32
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:54,125
Last glimpse of the world

33
00:03:55,525 --> 00:04:03,084
Planet Earth is blue, and there's nothing left to do

34
00:04:04,283 --> 00:04:11,457
(acoustic guitar riffs)

35
00:04:11,457 --> 00:04:25,505
(instrumental)
